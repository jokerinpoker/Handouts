Reflection

During the implementation of the AI for Tic-Tac-Toe, I learned how to use recursion and how to apply complex algorithms to real-world projects. The minimax algorithm, coupled with recursion, presented a perfect opportunity for me to develop my understanding of these concepts and enhance my problem-solving skills.

The most enjoyable aspect of this project was seeing the AI opponet to compete with human player, provding an challenging gaming experience. The AI oppoent is not randomly moving. It exploring all possible moves and evaluting their outcomes. With minimax algorith, the human player cannot win in this tic-tac-toe, the draw is the best result I can get. 

However, the journey was not without its challenges. The most significant struggle was learning the minimax algorithm of AI component, as it required a good understanding of recursion techniques. Another significant challenges I faced was understanding how the minimax algorithm applying it effectively in the code. It took time and effort to grasp the intricacies of the algorithm and implement it correctly within the context of the game. This algorithm is an essential concept in artificial intelligence, and mastering it significantly improved my problem-solving and exteneded my horizon of artificial intelligence field that I never met before. Moreover, designing the tests to ensure the game's correctness and reliability also presented its own set of challenges.

Despite these hurdles, the project has inspired me to further explore artificial intelligence and game development. In the future, I aim to work on creating more complex games and decision-making applications, employing machine learning techniques and other advanced algorithms to enhance the AI component.

Overall, this project has played a pivotal role in shaping my future goals as a programmer. It has not only piqued my interest in game development and AI but also equipped me with essential minimax skills and knowledge. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and tackling more complex projects in the future.
